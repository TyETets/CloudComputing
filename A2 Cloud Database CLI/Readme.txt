To run the script:
  enter: python CreateReports.py
  Have database.py, add_missing_data.py and CreateReports.py in the same directory.
  Have csv files in the same format as the given examples for this assignment

Normal Behaviour:
  1. Upon startup script will ask if you would like add new data.
  2a. If yes, then table name and the names of the csv files will be prompted for.
  2b. if no, then a prompt asking which report the user would like will appear
  3. User selects report A or B
  3b. User selects delete or d to delete a table
  4. User inputs necessary table selections and country or year selections
  5. A report about said country or year is shown in the command prompt

Limitations:
  Reports do not show rankings and do not sort by rankings
  Report B only allows for 2019 data to be shown
